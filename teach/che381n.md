> __Welcome to the study of advanced transport phenomena in Spring 2025!__

The principles of mass, momentum, and energy transport are relevant across
scales—from sub-cellular to atmospheric—and across disciplines.
This one-semester graduate course provides students with the tools to understand
and describe such a diverse set of phenomena.
Relevant ideas from vector and tensor calculus are reviewed, as partial
differential equations are the natural language of transport phenomena.
General concepts from continuum mechanics are introduced, and the balance laws
of mass, momentum, and energy are rigorously derived from first principles.
Applications of the balance laws are studied, with the goal of developing a
physical understanding of various phenomena.
The concepts of non-dimensionalization and scaling are emphasized throughout.

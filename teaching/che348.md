> __Welcome to *CHE 348: Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering* in Fall 2024!__

The significant increase in available compute over the last several decades has led to a transformation in the methods and techniques for solving science and engineering
problems. To use new tools effectively, it is crucial that we understand their *theoretical underpinnings* and *limitations,* as well as *practical details of their implementation.*

__CHE 348__ is a one-semester advanced undergraduate course providing students with a fundamental understanding of *common numerical methods* spanning

* chemical engineering,
* computational science, and
* applied mathematics.

In problems studied, __the underlying physics is emphasized throughout,__ with principles from __*non-dimensionalization*__ frequently employed.

While the ideas presented are general (and thus not tied to any specific programming language), the entirety of the course will be carried out in [Julia](https://julialang.org/)â€”a powerful, easy-to-use language designed for scientists and engineers.

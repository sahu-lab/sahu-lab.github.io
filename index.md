We are a theoretical laboratory in the [McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering](https://che.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu){:target="_blank"}.
Our research group brings together ideas from engineering, physics, and applied mathematics to understand biology.
We currently use theory and simulation to describe the coupling between electrical and mechanical phenomena in the cell, with the goal of understanding the behavior of neurons.

# Joining the Lab

We frequently draw from the fields of [continuum mechanics][continuum_mechanics]{:target="_blank"} ([fluid][fluid_mechanics]{:target="_blank"} and [solid][solid_mechanics]{:target="_blank"} mechanics), transport phenomena, [thermodynamics][thermodynamics]{:target="_blank"}, [statistical physics][statistical_mechanics]{:target="_blank"}, and electrodynamics.
In doing so, we formulate analytical theories and employ numerical methods---for example, the [finite element method][finite_element_method]{:target="_blank"} and [molecular dynamics][molecular_dynamics]{:target="_blank"} simulations.

We are actively seeking scientists and engineers who are interested in our research program:

- **Graduate Students**

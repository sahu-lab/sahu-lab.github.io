We are a theoretical research group in the [Chemical Engineering Department](https://che.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu){:target="_blank"}.
We broadly focus on understanding various systems over many length and time scales.
In doing so, a motivating question arises:
How do microscopic interactions lead to emergent physics at mesoscopic or macroscopic scales?
<br>

To address this question, we bring together ideas from engineering, physics, computer science, and applied mathematics.
For example:

* We use [statistical mechanical methods][statistical_mechanics]{:target="_blank"} to describe equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior over microscopic scales
* Our findings inform the [continuum mechanical descriptions][continuum_mechanics]{:target="_blank"} of these same systems
* If classical techniques are intractable, we employ physics-based [machine learning methods][machine_learning]{:target="_blank"}---which we require to satisfy the known physical laws governing the system of interest

# Joining the Lab

We frequently draw from the fields of [continuum mechanics][continuum_mechanics]{:target="_blank"} ([fluid][fluid_mechanics]{:target="_blank"} and [solid][solid_mechanics]{:target="_blank"} mechanics), transport phenomena, [thermodynamics][thermodynamics]{:target="_blank"}, [statistical physics][statistical_mechanics]{:target="_blank"}, and electrodynamics.
In doing so, we formulate analytical theories and employ numerical methods---for example, the [finite element method][finite_element_method]{:target="_blank"} and [molecular dynamics][molecular_dynamics]{:target="_blank"} simulations.
We also develop physics-based [machine learning][machine_learning]{:target="_blank"} methods that satisfy the appropriate balance laws and associated governing equations.

We are actively seeking scientists and engineers who are interested in our research program:
